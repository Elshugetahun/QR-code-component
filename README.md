## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Dasktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that using width: 100% instead of a fixed width helps make a webpage responsive on mobile devices.removed fixed widths and replaced them with fluid widths that adapt to screen size.

```css
/* Image responsive */
.qr-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about building responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes.
